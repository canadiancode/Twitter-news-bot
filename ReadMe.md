A bot that summarized 3 crypto news articles per day by using the OpenAI.

- I am getting the error below from Render.com:

Error: Could not find Chromium (rev. 1108766). This can occur if either

1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. `npm install`)

2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /opt/render/.cache/puppeteer).
